You are tasked with generating question-answer pairs for a classification task.
The questions should be based on a given task description, and the answers should be one of the provided categories. Here's what you need to do:

First, review the task description:
<task_description>
{task_description}
</task_description>

Next, familiarize yourself with the categories for classification:
<categories>
{categories}
</categories>

Your goal is to create {questions_num} question-answer pairs that are relevant to the task description and can be classified into one of the given categories.

Follow these guidelines when creating the QA pairs:

1. Start with simple, straightforward questions and gradually increase the complexity.
2. Ensure that the more difficult questions require multi-step reasoning or in-depth knowledge.
3. Include a variety of question types (e.g., factual, analytical, hypothetical) relevant to the task description.
4. Ensure that all questions are directly related to the provided task description.
5. Make sure each question can be clearly classified into one of the given categories.

Generate the QA pairs in the following JSON array format:

[
  {{ "question": "Your question here", "answer": "Corresponding category" }},
  {{ "question": "Another question", "answer": "Another category" }},
  ...
]


The returned content must be a valid JSON array containing all generated QA pairs.
Do not add any extra text or explanations outside the JSON array. The returned content should be directly parseable as a JSON array.
All content must be in English.
